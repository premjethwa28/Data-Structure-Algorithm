#Introduction:
This project implements and compares the runtime of Sorting Algorithm for various input. Following are the implemented algorithms:
1.Mergesort
2.Heapsort
3.Quicksort (Last element pivot)
4.Quicksort (3 median approach)
5.Insertion sort
6.Selection sort
7.Bubble sort

These algorithms creates a random unsorted array/list, and user selects the type of sorting algorithm needed 
to sort the given array/list.

It also calculates the run time required for the algorithm to sort the array. 
Comparative study can also be done to compare the time complexity for each algorithm.
